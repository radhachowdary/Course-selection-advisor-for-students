# Course-selection-advisor-for-students
The Utility-Based Course Selection Agent is an intelligent system designed to help students select the most suitable courses based on their preferences and academic goals. The agent evaluates courses based on various factors such as course content, workload, schedule feasibility, and difficulty level and assigns a utility score to each course. It then recommends a schedule that maximizes the student's learning experience.
